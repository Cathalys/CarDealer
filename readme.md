Hello,

I would like to be able to supervise my car dealership !

First of all, i would like to be able to add, update and see my employees.
I want them to be separated by their profession (sales, mechanics, workshop chiefs).

I want to list them, create, update and remove them.
Regarding employees informations, i want to be able to :

- Create a new employee (firstname, lastname, date of birth, function/profession, seniority).
- Update any data regarding any employees.
- Remove an employee.

I also want to be able to list the car park.
I need to :

- Add a new car to the park.
- Update any infirmations concerning a car.
- Remove a car, if necessary.

I need a web application to manage.
